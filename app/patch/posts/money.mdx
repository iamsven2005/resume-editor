# Credit System
To manage the hosting cost, I set a limit of $5 to a 20 credit resume, of course you can wait till the next month for new credits. Do tell me if this is too expensive and I can adjust accordingly.

## Features
- You can view and create discussion topics now
- Check credit use at the top bar
- Changed tabs to dropdown for eazier navigation
- added basic tutorial and video calling
