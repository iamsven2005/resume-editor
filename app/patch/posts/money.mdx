- added pwa install support for easier access
- Allow search of candidates from the platform

## You might be wondering
Originally, bihance was meant to be business enhanced, a solution company meant to enhance the daily workflow of businesses. We started off with one of the common problems that we wanted to solve, event management where we saw there was a need for tracking large number of employees to pay hourly wages. We made a pretty decent all in one event management tool of which we went to pitch to all the event companies in Singapore and most ended up saying that they still prefer using whatsapp even if it is more of a hassle. This means we were not solving the right problems.

## Sparkjob - Tinder for finding jobs
Through the interviews, we found that management of manpower was more of a problem that they were looking out for, and so we looked around to our fellow students and we throught, maybe the problem lies in how long it takes to apply for a job. What bettr way to find a job than swiping, we know your preferences yet still be very acute to the job. For each application you sent, we email the employer, and send a custom resume on your behalf. But people were not finding jobs and many manpower agencies quit, but why? We called them again and found that there was a mismatch in commitment, skills and time for both sides and ultimately we did not have a plan to pivot from there.

## Sparkjob - Your Resume Builder
